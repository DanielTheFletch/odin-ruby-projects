# Ruby: Assorted Projects

A central hub for the majority of my early Ruby projects, all done as part of The Odin Project's web development
curriculum. Note that this repository contains all but two (2) of the required projects in the Ruby course. The
projects not included here&mdash;both **Conect Four** and the **Ruby Final Project**&mdash;have their own
dedicated repositories.

## Project Lookup

Each root-level directory represents a module from the introductory Ruby course, and each subdirectory represents
a given project from that module. All relevant files for a given project are contained in the corresponding subdirectory.
Consult the directory tree below to determine the location of a specific project.
