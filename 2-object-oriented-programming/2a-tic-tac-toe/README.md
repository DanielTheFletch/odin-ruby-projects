# Project 2a: Tic Tac Toe

The classic game of Tic Tac Toe, playable by two human players at the command line.

Example run:

```rb
> bubble_sort([17, 3, 6, 9, 15, 8, 6, 1, 10])
=> [1, 3, 6, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 17]
```

## File Structure

```
.
├── lib/
|   └── placeholder

├── main.rb
└── README.md
```

## Demo File

To run the included demo file (`demo.rb`), copy this directory into your own environment. With Ruby installed, execute the following command from within the copied directory:

```
