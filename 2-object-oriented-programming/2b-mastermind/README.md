# Project 2b: Mastermind

Welcome to the world of [Mastermind](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Mastermind)!

In this color-coded bout of secrecy and deduction, one player must guess their opponent's secret 4-color code within a certain number of turns. Each turn, the decoder receives feedback regarding the accuracy of their guess&mdash;for instance, whether a peg is exactly correct or just the correct color but in the wrong space (think [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) but with colored pegs instead of letters).

This command line implementation features three main modes:
1. Head to Head. The standard Mastermind game as played in a tabletop setting, featuring one decoder and one encoder.
2. Decoding vs. COM. Play the game of Mastermind solo against a computer. The computer plays the role of the encoder.
3. Encoding vs. COM. Play the game of Mastermind solo against a computer. The computer plays the role of the decoder.
