# Project 1d: Bubble Sort

My Ruby implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.

Consider the following example from the project specifications:

```rb
> bubble_sort([17, 3, 6, 9, 15, 8, 6, 1, 10])
=> [1, 3, 6, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 17]
```

## Included Files

- `bubble.rb` &ndash; Contains all methods and implementations required by the project specifications, including:
    - `#bubble_sort` &ndash; Takes in an array of integer values and returns an array sorted in ascending order.
- `demo.rb` &ndash; Contains sample code for demonstrating the project's functionality. To run the demo, please see the instructions below.
- `README.md` &ndash; The file you're currently reading!

## Demo File

To run the included demo file (`demo.rb`), copy this directory into your own environment. With Ruby installed, execute the following command from within the copied directory:

```
$ ruby demo.rb
```

The demo presents four (4) hard-coded examples along with one interactive example that calls for user input.
