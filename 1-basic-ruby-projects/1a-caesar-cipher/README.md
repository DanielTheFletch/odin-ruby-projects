# Project 1a: Caesar Cipher

My Ruby implementation of the encryption technique known as the **Caesar cipher**. Includes a demonstration file for use at the terminal.

## Included Files

- `caesar.rb` &ndash; Contains all code and functions required by the project specifications, including:
    - `caesar_cipher(phrase, shift)` &ndash; Performs the Caesar cipher algorithm on `phrase` by the given `shift` amount.
- `demo.rb` &ndash; Contains sample code for demonstrating the project's functionality.
To run the demo, please see the instructions below.
- `README.md` &ndash; The file you're currently reading!

## Demo File

To run the included demo file (`demo.rb`), clone this directory into your own environment. With Ruby installed, execute the following command from within the cloned directory:

```
$ ruby demo.rb
```

The demo presents six (6) hard-coded examples along with one interactive example that calls for user input.
