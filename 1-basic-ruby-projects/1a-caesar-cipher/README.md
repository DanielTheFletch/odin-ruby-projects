# Project 1a: Caesar Cipher

My Ruby implementation of the encryption technique known as the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).

Consider these examples:

```rb
> caesar_cipher("What a string!", 5)
=> "Bmfy f xywnsl!"

> caesar_cipher("Spwwz, xj ylxp td Olytpw", 15)
=> "Hello, my name is Daniel"
```

## Included Files

- `caesar.rb` &ndash; Contains all methods and implementations required by the project specifications, including:
    - `#caesar_cipher` &ndash; Takes in a string and the shift factor as arguments; returns the modified string.
- `demo.rb` &ndash; Contains sample code for demonstrating the project's functionality.
To run the demo, please see the instructions below.
- `README.md` &ndash; The file you're currently reading!

## Demo File

To run the included demo file (`demo.rb`), clone this directory into your own environment. With Ruby installed, execute the following command from within the cloned directory:

```
$ ruby demo.rb
```

The demo presents six (6) hard-coded examples along with one interactive example that calls for user input.
